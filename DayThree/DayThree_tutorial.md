### Day Three
Today, we'll again be working with the Qfly dataset. We'll use three key methods to determine the significance of predictor climatic variables 
in explaining allele frequency patterns in the native and introduced ranges of the Queensland fruit fly:

1. Gradient Forest
2. RDA
3. LFMM
   
Let's get into it!

### Open R and load in required packages
First, set you working directory to something logical (e.g., a 'DayThree' folder on your desktop), and run all code from within that directory.
```
library(geodata)
library(ozmaps)
