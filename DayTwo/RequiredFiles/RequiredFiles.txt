To successfully run DayTwo, you'll need to download the following files and put them into your DayTwo directory:
Qfly.vcf
Qfly_popmap.txt
Qfly_scaffold_list.txt
Qfly_chromosomes-chrNumbers.txt
Qfly_NativevsIslands.ecotype
Qfly_NativevsExpanded.ecotype
Qfly_NativevsAlice.ecotype
Qfly.bp

In addition, if you cannot get BayPass to run, I have provided the three key output files here (directory: BackupFiles/):
Qfly_NativevsAlice_summary_contrast.out
Qfly_NativevsExpanded_summary_contrast.out
Qfly_NativevsIslands_summary_contrast.out
Ideally, you won't need these, so it would pay to only download them later (if you can't successfully run BayPass).
